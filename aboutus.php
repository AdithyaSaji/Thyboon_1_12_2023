    We launched our Supplier Diversity program to ensure that we purchase more goods and services from businesses that are certified as majority-owned and operated by women, minorities, veterans, members of the LGBTQ community, and people with disabilities. 
    In doing so, we can help underrepresented groups succeed while we benefit from the ideas and innovations that diverse perspectives bring.</p>
